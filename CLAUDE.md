This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

The Felix Framework is a **completed research project** exploring helix-based cognitive architecture for multi-agent systems. The project successfully translated a 3D geometric helix model (`thefelix.md`) into a computational framework where autonomous agents navigate spiral processing paths with spoke-based communication to a central coordination system.

**This is completed research with validated results.** The framework has been implemented, tested, and validated with statistical rigor suitable for publication.

## Core Architecture Concepts

- **Helix Path**: Non-linear processing pipeline where agents traverse a spiral from broad (top) to focused (bottom)
- **Nodes**: Autonomous agents with independent spawn timing and specialized functions
- **Spokes**: Communication channels connecting agents to the central coordination system (O(N) complexity)
- **Central Post**: Core memory/coordination system maintaining system state
- **Geometric Tapering**: Natural attention focusing mechanism through radius reduction (4,119x concentration ratio)

**Implemented Mathematical Foundation**: Parametric helix generation with 33 turns, tapering from radius 33 to 0.001, with 133 nodes representing cognitive agents. Mathematical precision validated to <1e-12 error against OpenSCAD prototype.

**Key Research Finding**: All agents spawn at the helix top (t=0) at different times, enabling natural attention focusing as they progress toward the narrow bottom.

## Critical Development Rules

**Every action must be justified, documented, and validated. No exceptions.**

Key requirements from docs/guides/development/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md:
- NO CODE without corresponding tests written FIRST
- Mandatory commit message template with WHY/WHAT/EXPECTED/ALTERNATIVES/TESTS
- Daily research log entries in `RESEARCH_LOG.md`
- All failed experiments preserved in `experiments/failed/`

## Working with This Codebase

### For Understanding the Completed Research
1. **Review RESEARCH_LOG.md** - Complete research journey and findings
2. **Understand the geometric model** - Review `thefelix.md` and `docs/architecture/core/mathematical_model.md`
3. **Examine validation results** - Run `python validate_felix_framework.py`
4. **Study the three architectures** - Helix-spoke (O(N)), Linear pipeline (O(N×M)), Mesh (O(N²))
5. **Review hypothesis outcomes** - See `docs/architecture/core/hypothesis_mathematics.md` for statistical frameworks

### For Extending the Research
1. **Understand agent spawning behavior** - All agents spawn at helix top (t=0) at different times
2. **Mathematical precision maintained** - <1e-12 error tolerance established and verified
3. **Test-first methodology proven** - All 107+ tests pass; follow same pattern for extensions
4. **Statistical validation framework ready** - Use `src/comparison/` for additional hypothesis testing
5. **Virtual environment required** - scipy/numpy dependencies for statistical analysis

### Key Research Insights for Future Work
- **H1 SUPPORTED**: Helix shows better task distribution efficiency (p=0.0441)
- **H2 INCONCLUSIVE**: Communication overhead measurement needs refinement
- **H3 NOT SUPPORTED**: Mathematical theory confirmed but empirical validation differs
- **Performance**: Linear pipeline surprisingly effective in test conditions
- **Memory efficiency**: Helix architecture most efficient (1,200 vs 4,800 units for mesh)

## LLM Integration Architecture

**Felix Framework now operates as a competitive alternative to LangGraph and similar multi-agent orchestration systems.**

### Core LLM Concepts
- **Geometric Orchestration**: Agents spawn and converge based on helix geometry, not explicit graph definitions
- **Natural Temperature Adjustment**: Agent creativity/temperature automatically adjusts based on helix position (0.1 at bottom, 0.9 at top)
- **Specialized Agent Types**: ResearchAgent (early spawn), AnalysisAgent (mid), SynthesisAgent (late), CriticAgent (as needed)
- **Multi-Model Support**: Different agent types can use different LLMs on single LM Studio server

### Agent-Model Mapping (Multi-Model Setup)
```python
# config/multi_model_config.json defines:
{
  "research": "research_fast",      # qwen/qwen3-4b-2507 (fast exploration)
  "analysis": "thinking_analysis",  # qwen/qwen3-4b-thinking-2507 (reasoning)
  "synthesis": "synthesis_quality", # google/gemma-3-12b (high-quality output)
  "critic": "thinking_analysis"     # qwen/qwen3-4b-thinking-2507 (validation)
}
```

### Felix vs LangGraph Architecture
| Felix Framework | LangGraph |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Geometric convergence | Explicit graph definitions |
| Time-based natural spawning | Manual trigger-based |
| O(N) spoke communication | Variable edge complexity |
| 3D visual debugging | Log-based debugging |
| "Spiral to consensus" mental model | State machine mental model |

## Research Context and Achievements

**This project successfully maintained research integrity while building software.** The goal was scientifically valid exploration of whether helix-based cognitive architecture offers advantages over traditional multi-agent systems.

### Success Metrics Achieved

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Mathematical Validation Failures
- **Error**: "Precision validation failed" → Check numpy version compatibility
- **Fix**: Ensure `numpy>=1.26.0` and run `python validate_mathematics.py`

### LLM Connection Issues
- **Error**: "Connection refused" → LM Studio not running
- **Fix**: Start LM Studio server, verify with `curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models`
- **Error**: "Model not found" → Required models not loaded in LM Studio
- **Fix**: Download and load required models in LM Studio interface

### Test Failures
- **Import errors**: Run from project root with activated virtual environment
- **Slow test timeout**: Use `python -m pytest tests/performance/ -m slow --timeout=300`
- **Coverage issues**: Ensure all `src/` modules have corresponding tests

### Multi-Model Setup Issues
- **Agent mapping errors**: Verify `config/multi_model_config.json` syntax
- **Concurrent processing not working**: Check LM Studio parallel request settings
- **Model switching failures**: Ensure sufficient GPU memory for all models

## Project Status and Development Approach

**This is a completed research project.** When extending:
1. Follow hypothesis-driven development from `docs/guides/development/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md`
2. Write tests BEFORE implementation (mandatory)
3. Document all changes in `RESEARCH_LOG.md`
4. Use ADRs for architectural decisions in `docs/architecture/decisions/`
5. Preserve failed experiments in `experiments/failed/`

The framework demonstrates that geometric-based multi-agent coordination offers measurable advantages in task distribution and memory efficiency while providing an intuitive "spiral to consensus" mental model for complex orchestration tasks.
