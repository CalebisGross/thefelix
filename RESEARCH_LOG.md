## 2025-08-18 - Day 1: Foundation Setup

### Objectives
- Establish project foundation and governance
- Create initial prototyping plan

- Document initial hypotheses

### Progress
✅ **Planning Phase Completed**
- Created comprehensive 4-week prototyping plan in `theplan.md`
- Established clear phases from foundation to validation
- Defined success criteria and risk mitigation strategies

✅ **Research Documentation**  
- Documented 3 primary hypotheses in `research/initial_hypothesis.md`:
  - H1: Helical paths improve task distribution
  - H2: Spoke communication reduces coordination overhead  
  - H3: Geometric tapering implements natural attention focusing
- Established testable predictions and measurement methods
- Defined null hypotheses and confounding variables

✅ **Technology Stack Decision**
- Created ADR-001 documenting Python 3.12 + pytest selection
- Rationale: Balances rapid prototyping with scientific rigor
- Risk mitigation strategies for performance and GIL limitations
- Timeline-compatible choice for 4-week constraint

✅ **Project Structure**
- Created full directory structure per plan:
  - `src/` with core, agents, communication, pipeline modules
  - `tests/` with unit, integration, performance divisions
  - `research/`, `decisions/`, `experiments/failed/` for governance
  - `benchmarks/`, `docs/` for analysis and documentation

✅ **Testing Framework**

2. **Test-first development**: Write tests for helix position calculations BEFORE implementation
3. **Validate against OpenSCAD**: Ensure Python implementation matches thefelix.md model
4. **Performance baseline**: Establish computation time baseline for helix calculations

### Research Questions Raised
- How precise do helix calculations need to be? (floating point vs exact arithmetic)
- Should we implement 2D projection fallback if 3D proves complex?
- What tolerance should we use for position validation against OpenSCAD model?

### Time Allocation
- Planning and documentation: 3 hours
- Project setup and configuration: 1 hour
