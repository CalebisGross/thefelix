It’s more than just a fun trick—it’s a real-world demonstration of fundamental physics. As the coin descends, gravity converts gravitational potential energy (*U = mgh*) into kinetic energy (*K = ½mv² + ½Iω²*), accelerating both its linear and rotational motion.\n\nThe spiral path arises due to **centripetal force**, provided by the funnel wall’s normal force. At each point, radial acceleration is *a_r = v²/r*, where *v* is speed and *r* is curvature radius. As the coin speeds up, this required centripetal force increases—maintained by the funnel’s shape.\n\nFriction between the coin and funnel slows rotation slightly but doesn’t stop motion. The coin’s angular momentum is conserved, though friction gradually reduces spin over time.\n\nIn essence, this simple motion illustrates Newtonian mechanics—gravity, circular dynamics, energy conservation, and rotational inertia—all in one elegant, observable scene. It reminds us that even the most ordinary moments reveal profound truths about how",
