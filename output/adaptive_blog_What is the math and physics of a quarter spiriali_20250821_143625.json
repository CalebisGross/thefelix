As the coin descends, gravity pulls it downward, while friction and normal forces keep it in contact with the funnel walls. The spiral path results from centripetal force—the inward force required to maintain circular motion at each point along the curve.\n\nMathematically, this motion combines Newton’s laws of motion with rotational dynamics. The radial acceleration needed for circular motion is provided by the funnel wall's normal force: *a_r = v²/r*, where *v* is speed and *r* is radius. As gravity accelerates the coin, its speed increases, requiring greater centripetal force—maintained by the funnel’s geometry.\n\nThough friction slows rotation slightly, gravity dominates, converting potential energy into kinetic energy. This everyday demo beautifully illustrates how Newtonian mechanics govern real-world motion—simple, elegant, and deeply instructive.\n\n**The Physics of a Quarter Spiraling Down a Funnel**\n\nAt the mall, a quarter spirals down a funnel—a simple yet elegant demonstration of physics. Gravity pulls the coin downward, accelerating it while friction and normal forces keep it in contact with the funnel wall. The spiral path results from centripetal force, which continuously acts toward the center, provided by the funnel",
