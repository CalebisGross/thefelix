"""
Spoke-based communication channels for the Felix Framework.

Implements the spoke connections between individual agents and the central post,
following the geometric model from thefelix.md where agents communicate along
radial spokes to the central coordination system.

Key Features:
- Bidirectional message passing (agent <-> central post)
- Reliable delivery with confirmation tracking
- Connection lifecycle management
- Message ordering and delivery guarantees
