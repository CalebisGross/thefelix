"""
Communication system for the Felix Framework.

This module implements both spoke-based and mesh communication architectures
for the helix system and comparison framework respectively.

Spoke Architecture:
- CentralPost: Hub for all agent communication
- Spoke: Individual communication channels
- O(N) scaling characteristics

Mesh Architecture:
- MeshCommunication: All-to-all topology for comparison
- MeshConnection: Pairwise agent connections  
- O(NÂ²) scaling characteristics for Hypothesis H2 validation

The system supports:
- Reliable message delivery in both architectures
- Performance metrics collection and comparison
- Statistical analysis for research validation
- Scalable agent connections
