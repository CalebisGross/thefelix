## What is Felix?

The Felix Framework is a **completed research project** that successfully translated a 3D geometric helix model into a computational framework for multi-agent cognitive architectures. The project demonstrates novel approaches to agent coordination using spiral processing paths with spoke-based communication to a central coordination system.

**Key Features:**
- 🌀 **Helix-based agent coordination** with geometric attention focusing
- 🤖 **LLM-powered agents** with automatic temperature adjustment
- 📡 **O(N) spoke communication** vs O(N²) mesh topology
- 📊 **Statistically validated** performance advantages
- 🧪 **Research-grade methodology** with 107+ passing tests

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Basic setup
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test the framework
python validate_felix_framework.py

# Try LLM features (requires LM Studio)
python examples/blog_writer.py "AI ethics"
python examples/benchmark_comparison.py --task "Research renewable energy"
```

## Need Help?

- **Issues or bugs**: Check the troubleshooting sections in individual guides
- **Understanding the theory**: Start with [Mathematical Model](../architecture/core/mathematical_model.md)
- **Using LLMs**: See [LLM Integration](../guides/llm-integration/LLM_INTEGRATION.md)
- **Contributing**: Follow [Development Rules](../guides/development/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md)
