# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection for Initial Prototype

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Deciders**: Research Team  
**Technical Story**: Initial prototype implementation technology choices

## Context

The Felix Framework initial prototype requires technology stack decisions that balance rapid prototyping needs with scientific rigor requirements. The system must implement complex mathematical models (helix geometry), multi-agent coordination, and performance measurement capabilities.

## Decision Drivers

- **Research timeline**: 4-week initial prototype delivery
- **Mathematical requirements**: 3D geometric calculations, parametric equations
- **Testing requirements**: Hypothesis validation, performance benchmarking
- **Documentation requirements**: Extensive research logging per DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md
- **Reproducibility**: Scientific method compliance
- **Performance measurement**: Baseline comparisons needed

## Considered Options

### Programming Language Options

#### Option A: Python 3.12
**Pros**:
- Rich scientific computing ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib)
- Rapid prototyping capabilities
- Excellent testing framework (pytest)
- Strong documentation tools (Sphinx)
- Available on current system (verified)

**Cons**:
- Performance limitations for compute-intensive tasks
- GIL limitations for true parallelism
- Memory overhead for agent systems

#### Option B: Rust
**Pros**:
- High performance, memory safety
- Excellent concurrency primitives
- Growing scientific computing ecosystem

**Cons**:
- Longer development time (incompatible with 4-week timeline)
- Less mature scientific computing libraries
- Steeper learning curve for rapid prototyping

#### Option C: Go
**Pros**:
- Excellent concurrency support
- Fast compilation and execution
- Simple deployment

**Cons**:
- Limited scientific computing ecosystem
- Less sophisticated mathematical libraries
- Fewer testing and documentation tools

### Testing Framework Options

#### Option A: pytest + hypothesis
**Pros**:
- Property-based testing for mathematical functions
- Excellent parametric testing support
- Rich ecosystem of plugins
- Available on system

**Cons**:
- Python-specific

#### Option B: unittest (Python standard library)
**Pros**:
- No additional dependencies
- Standard library stability

**Cons**:
- Less powerful than pytest
- No property-based testing built-in

### Performance Profiling Options

#### Option A: cProfile + memory_profiler
**Pros**:
- Built into Python standard library (cProfile)
- Detailed memory tracking capabilities
- Integration with existing Python workflow

**Cons**:
- Python-specific, may not detect all performance issues

## Decision

**Selected**: Python 3.12 + pytest + hypothesis + NumPy ecosystem

### Technology Stack Details:
- **Language**: Python 3.12.3 (verified available)
- **Testing**: pytest 7.4.4 + hypothesis for property-based testing
- **Mathematics**: NumPy 1.26.4 (verified available) + pure Python for helix calculations
- **Performance**: cProfile + memory_profiler
- **Documentation**: Sphinx for technical docs, markdown for research
- **Visualization**: matplotlib for 2D plots, potential plotly for 3D if needed

## Rationale

1. **Timeline Compatibility**: Python enables rapid prototyping within 4-week constraint
2. **Mathematical Support**: NumPy provides robust foundation for geometric calculations
3. **Testing Rigor**: pytest + hypothesis enables scientific-grade testing methodology
4. **Performance Measurement**: Sufficient profiling tools for baseline establishment
5. **Documentation**: Rich ecosystem supports extensive documentation requirements
6. **Availability**: All core components verified present on development system

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Mathematics
- Implement helix geometry using pure Python for clarity
- Add NumPy optimizations only if performance testing shows bottlenecks
- Use hypothesis for property-based testing of mathematical functions

### Phase 2: Agent System
- Use multiprocessing (not threading) to avoid GIL limitations
- Implement message passing with queue-based communication
- Profile memory usage early and often

### Phase 3: Performance Baseline
- Implement equivalent linear pipeline in same technology stack
- Use cProfile for CPU profiling, memory_profiler for memory analysis
- Establish baseline metrics before optimization attempts

## Performance Risk Mitigation

1. **If Python proves too slow**: 
   - Implement critical path functions in NumPy
   - Consider Cython for computational hotspots
   - Document performance limitations as research constraints

2. **If GIL becomes limiting**:
   - Use multiprocessing for agent isolation
   - Implement message passing instead of shared memory
   - Document concurrency model impact on results

3. **If memory overhead is excessive**:
   - Implement object pooling for agents
   - Use generators instead of lists where possible
   - Profile and optimize data structures

## Success Criteria for Technology Choice

1. **Functional**: Successfully implement all components within timeline
2. **Performance**: Achieve measurable baseline comparison with linear architecture
3. **Testable**: Full test coverage of mathematical functions and agent behaviors
4. **Documented**: Complete research documentation and reproducible results

## Future Considerations

This technology stack is specifically for the initial prototype. Future phases may require:
- High-performance language (Rust/C++) for production systems
- Distributed computing framework for large-scale agent systems
- Real-time visualization tools for system monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development enabling focus on research questions
- Rich testing ecosystem supporting scientific methodology
- Extensive documentation and analysis capabilities
- Lower barrier to external validation and reproduction

### Negative
- Performance ceiling may limit scalability research
- Python-specific implementation may not translate to production systems
- GIL limitations may artificially constrain parallelism experiments
